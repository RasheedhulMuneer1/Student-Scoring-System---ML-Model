# Student-Scoring-System---ML-Model
This project uses a Supervised ML model (Linear Regression) to predict student marks based on study time. Developed in Python with Jupyter Notebook and VS Code, the model was trained on labeled data. A simple API was created and tested using Postman for real-time predictions.
