# 📊 Student Scoring System - ML Model (Supervised Learning)

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective **Supervised Machine Learning** model that predicts student marks based on the number of hours they study. The core idea is to show how a **linear regression model** can be trained using labeled data to make accurate predictions.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- 📘 **Problem Statement**: Given the number of hours a student studies, predict their expected score.
- 🔬 **ML Type**: Supervised Learning (Regression)
- 🧠 **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression
- 🧪 **Evaluation**: Visualized predictions, tested using a REST API and Postman

## 💡 Features

- Trained a regression model on sample data.
- Visualized regression line vs actual data.
- Built and tested a **Flask API** to make predictions via HTTP requests.
- Tested API endpoints using **Postman**.
